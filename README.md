# KataWordWrap

## Intro

CodeKata in which you simply wrap a string by inserting line breaks after a certain number of characters (columns).

Find a detailed description [@CodingDojo] (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataWordWrap "CodingDojo rulz!")

## Motivation

The goal is to see how performance of an algorithm affects the readablilty of the code (and what might be a good compromise).

## Notes

- You can checkout the branch `raw-project` to start with a minimal  project (POM, empty class, empty test class)
- The `final` keyword is ommitted for sakes of readability
- Good software design / arcitecture is not a primary goal (although not "prohibited")
